It trades predominantly in South Africa as well as through owned and franchise stores across 13 African markets. It targets a wide range of customers and is well known for its fashion-value offering. The groupâ€™s trading divisions have evolved over time which has expanded its offering to apparel, cosmetics, homeware and sportswear merchandise through five trading divisions, namely: Mr Price, Miladys, Mr Price Sport, Mr Price Home and Sheet Street. It services its customers through its extensive store network as well as through its online platforms. It also has an established financial services division, Mr Price Money, which focuses on offering credit and insurance products, as well as a fast growing cellular offering.</h3>
